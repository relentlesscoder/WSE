<p><b>"Send in the Clowns"</b> is a <a href="Song" title="Song">song</a> by <a href="Stephen_Sondheim" title="Stephen Sondheim">Stephen Sondheim</a> from the 1973 <a href="Musical_theater" title="Musical theater" class="mw-redirect">musical</a> <i><a href="A_Little_Night_Music" title="A Little Night Music">A Little Night Music</a></i>, an adaptation of <a href="Ingmar_Bergman" title="Ingmar Bergman">Ingmar Bergman</a>'s film <i><a href="Smiles_of_a_Summer_Night" title="Smiles of a Summer Night">Smiles of a Summer Night</a></i>. It is a <a href="Ballad" title="Ballad">ballad</a> from Act II in which the character Desirée reflects on the ironies and disappointments of her life. Among other things, she looks back on an affair years earlier with the lawyer Fredrik. Meeting him after so long, she finds that he is now in an <a href="Consummation" title="Consummation">unconsummated</a> marriage with a much younger woman. Desirée proposes marriage to rescue him from this situation, but he declines, citing his dedication to his bride. Reacting to his rejection, Desirée sings this song. The song is later reprised as a <a href="Coda_(music)" title="Coda (music)">coda</a> after Fredrik's young wife runs away with his son, and Fredrik is finally free to accept Desirée's offer.</p>
<p>Sondheim wrote the song specifically for the actress <a href="Glynis_Johns" title="Glynis Johns">Glynis Johns</a>, who created the role of Desirée on <a href="Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a>. The song is structured with four verses and a bridge, and uses a complex <a href="Meter_(music)#Compound_meter" title="Meter (music)">compound meter</a>. It became Sondheim's most popular song after <a href="Frank_Sinatra" title="Frank Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> recorded it in 1973 and <a href="Judy_Collins" title="Judy Collins">Judy Collins</a>' version charted in 1975 and 1977.

<p>The "clowns" in the title do not refer to circus clowns. Instead, they symbolize fools, as Sondheim explained in a 1990 interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I get a lot of letters over the years asking what the title means and what the song's about; I never thought it would be in any way esoteric. I wanted to use theatrical imagery in the song, because she's an <i>actress,</i> but it's not supposed to be a circus [...] [I]t's a theater reference meaning "if the show isn't going well, let's send in the clowns"; in other words, "let's do the jokes." I always want to know, when I'm writing a song, what the end is going to be, so "Send in the Clowns" didn't settle in until I got the notion, "Don't bother, they're here", which means that "We are the fools."<sup id="cite_ref-Lincoln_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lincoln-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a 2008 interview, Sondheim further clarified:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I think of it now, the song could have been called "Send in the Fools". I knew I was writing a song in which Desirée is saying, "aren't we foolish" or "aren't we fools?" Well, a synonym for fools is clowns, but "Send in the Fools" doesn't have the same ring to it.<sup id="cite_ref-Gussow_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gussow-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="A_Little_Night_Music" title="A Little Night Music">A Little Night Music</a></div>
<p>In an interview with <a href="Alan_Titchmarsh" title="Alan Titchmarsh">Alan Titchmarsh</a>, <a href="Judi_Dench" title="Judi Dench">Judi Dench</a>, who performed the role of Desirée in London, commented on the context of the song. The play is "a dark play about people who, at the beginning, are with wrong partners and in the end it is hopefully going to become right, and she (Desiree) mistimes her life in a way and realizes when she re-meets the man she had an affair with and had a child by (though he does not know that), that she loves him and he is the man she wants."<sup id="cite_ref-Dench_I_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dench_I-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Some years before the play begins, Desirée was a young, attractive actress, whose passions were the theater and men. She lived her life dramatically, flitting from man to man. Fredrik was one of her many lovers and fell deeply in love with Desirée, but she declined to marry him. The play implies that when they parted Desirée may have been pregnant with his child.</p>
<p>A few months before the play begins, Fredrik married a beautiful woman who at 18 years old was much younger than he. In Act One, Fredrik meets Desirée again, and is introduced to her daughter, a precocious adolescent suggestively named Fredrika. Fredrik explains to Desirée that he is now married to the young woman, whom he loves, but who is still a virgin and refuses to have sex with him. Desirée and Fredrik then make love.</p>
<p>Act Two begins days later, and Desirée realizes that she truly loves Fredrik. She tells Fredrik that he needs to be rescued from his marriage, and she proposes to him. Fredrik explains to Desirée that he has been swept off the ground and is "in the air" in love with his beautiful, young wife, and apologizes for having misled her. Fredrik walks across the room, while Desirée remains sitting on the bed; as she feels both intense sadness and anger, at herself, her life and her choices, she sings, "Send in the Clowns." Not long thereafter, Fredrik's young wife runs away with his son, and he is free to accept Desirée's proposal, and the song is reprised as a coda.</p>

<p>Sondheim wrote the lyrics and music over a two-day period during rehearsals for the play's Broadway debut,<sup id="cite_ref-Academy_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Academy-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> specifically for the actress <a href="Glynis_Johns" title="Glynis Johns">Glynis Johns</a>, who created the role of Desirée.<sup id="cite_ref-Academy_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Academy-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> According to Sondheim, "Glynis had a lovely, crystal voice, but sustaining notes was not her thing. I wanted to write short phrases, so I wrote a song full of questions" and the song's melody is within a small music range:<sup id="cite_ref-Gussow_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gussow-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We hired Glynis Johns to play the lead, though she had a nice little silvery voice. But I'd put all the vocal weight of the show on the other characters because we needed somebody who was glamorous, charming and could play light comedy, and pretty, and to find that in combination with a good voice is very unlikely, but she had all the right qualities and a nice little voice. So I didn't write much for her and I didn't write anything in the second act.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And the big scene between her and her ex-lover, I had started on a song for him because it's his scene. And <a href="Hal_Prince" title="Hal Prince" class="mw-redirect">Hal Prince</a>, who directed it, said he thought that the second act needed a song for her, and this was the scene to do it in. And so he directed the scene in such a way that even though the dramatic thrust comes from the man's monologue, and she just sits there and reacts, he directed it so you could feel the weight going to her reaction rather than his action.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And I went down and saw it and it seemed very clear what was needed, and so that made it very easy to write. And then I wrote it for her voice, because she couldn't sustain notes. Wasn't that kind of singing voice. So I knew I had to write things in short phrases, and that led to questions, and so again, I wouldn't have written a song so quickly if I hadn't known the actress.... I wrote most of it one night and finished part of the second chorus, and I'd gotten the ending.... [T]he whole thing was done in two days.<sup id="cite_ref-Academy_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Academy-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>

<p>The lyrics of the song are written in four <a href="Verse_(popular_music)" title="Verse (popular music)" class="mw-redirect">verses</a> and a bridge and sung by Desirée. As Sondheim explains, Desirée experiences both deep regret and furious anger:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Send in the Clowns" was never meant to be a soaring ballad; it's a song of regret. And it's a song of a lady who is too upset and too angry to speak– meaning to sing for a very long time. She is furious, but she doesn't want to make a scene in front of Fredrik because she recognizes that his obsession with his 18-year-old wife is unbreakable. So she gives up; so it's a song of regret and anger, and therefore fits in with short-breathed phrases.<sup id="cite_ref-Lincoln_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lincoln-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The song was originally written in the primary key of Eb major.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The song uses an unusual and complex meter, which alternates between 12/8 and 9/8.<sup id="cite_ref-Lincoln_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lincoln-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> These are two complex <a href="Meter_(music)#Compound_meter" title="Meter (music)">compound meters</a> that evoke the sense of a waltz used throughout the score of the show. Sondheim tells the story:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When I worked with <a href="Leonard_Bernstein" title="Leonard Bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a> on <i><a href="West_Side_Story_(musical)" title="West Side Story (musical)" class="mw-redirect">West Side Story</a></i>, one of the things I learned from him was not always necessarily to think in terms of 2-, 4- and 8-bar phrases. I was already liberated enough before I met him not to be sticking to 32-bar songs, but I tend to think square. I tend to think ... it's probably because I was brought up on mid-19th and late-19th Century music, and you know it's fairly square; there are not an awful lot of meter changes.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You often will shorten or lengthen a bar for rhythmic purposes and for energy, but ... when you switch in the middle [of a song], particularly when it's a modest song, when you're not writing an aria, you know ... [I mean,] if you're writing something like <i><a href="Sweeney_Todd__The_Demon_Barber_of_Fleet_Street_(musical)" title="Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (musical)" class="mw-redirect">Sweeney Todd</a></i>, where people sing at great length, you <i>expect</i> switches of meter, because it helps variety. But in a little 36- or 40-bar song, to switch meters around is almost perverse, because the song doesn't get a chance to establish its own rhythm.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But the problem is, what would you do?: Would you go, "Isn't it rich? (two, three) Are we a pair? (two, three) Me here at last on the ground (three), you in mid-air." Lenny [Bernstein] taught me to think in terms of, "Do you really need the extra beat (after 'ground') or not." Just because you've got four bars of four, if you come across a bar that doesn't need the extra beat, then put a bar of three in. So ... the 9 [beat bars] and 12 [beat bars] that alternate in that song were not so much consciously arrived at as they were by the emotionality of the lyric.<sup id="cite_ref-Lincoln_1-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lincoln-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>

<p>"Send in the Clowns" is performed in two completely different styles: dramatic and lyric. The dramatic style is the theatrical performance by Desirée, and this style emphasizes Desirée's feelings of anger and regret, and the dramatic style acts as a cohesive part of the play. The lyric style is the concert performance, and this style emphasizes the sweetness of the melody and the poetry of the lyrics. Most performances are in concert, so they emphasize the beauty of the melody and lyrics.</p>
<p>Sondheim teaches both dramatic and lyric performers several important elements for an accurate rendition:<sup id="cite_ref-Guildhall_II_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Guildhall_II-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dramatic performer must take on the character of Desirée: a woman who finally realizes that she has misspent her youth on the shallow life. She is both angry and sad, and both must be seen in the performance. Two important examples are the contrast between the lines, "Quick, send in the clowns" and "Well, maybe next year." Sondheim teaches that the former should be steeped in self-loathing, while the latter should emphasize regret.<sup id="cite_ref-Guildhall_II_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Guildhall_II-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Thus, the former is clipped, with a break between "quick" and "send," while the latter "well" is held pensively.<sup id="cite_ref-Guildhall_II_6-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Guildhall_II-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sondheim himself apologizes for flaws in his composition. For example, in the line, "Well, maybe next year," the melodic emphasis is on the word <i>year</i> but the dramatic emphasis must be on the word <i>next</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word "next" is important: "Maybe <i>next</i> year" as opposed to "<i>this</i> year". [Desirée means,] "All right, I've screwed it up this year. Maybe next year I'll do something right in my life." So [it's] "well, maybe <i>next</i> year" even though it isn't accented in the music. This is a place where the lyric and the music aren't as apposite as they might be, because the important word is "next", and yet the accented word is "year". That's my fault, but [something the performer must] overcome.<sup id="cite_ref-Guildhall_I_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Guildhall_I-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another example arises from Sondheim's roots as a speaker of American rather than British English: The line "Don't you love farce?" features two juxtaposed <a href="Fricative_consonant#Central_non-sibilant_fricatives" title="Fricative consonant">labiodental fricative</a> sounds (the former [<i>v</i>] voiced, the latter [<i>f</i>] devoiced). American concert and stage performers will often fail to "breathe" and/or "voice" between the two fricatives, leading audiences familiar with British slang to hear "Don't you love <a href="Buttocks" title="Buttocks">arse</a>?," misinterpreting the lyric or at the least perceiving an unintended <a href="Double_entendre" title="Double entendre">double entendre</a>. Sondheim agrees that "[i]t's an awkward moment in the lyric, but that <i>v</i> and that <i>f</i> should be separated."<sup id="cite_ref-Guildhall_I_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Guildhall_I-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In the line of the fourth verse, "I thought that you'd want what I want. Sorry, my dear," the performer must communicate the connection between the "want" and the "sorry".<sup id="cite_ref-Guildhall_II_6-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Guildhall_II-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Similarly, Sondheim insists that performers separately enunciate the adjacent <i>t</i>s in the line, "There ought to be clowns."<sup id="cite_ref-Guildhall_II_6-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Guildhall_II-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
